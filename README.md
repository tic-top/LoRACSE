## Instructions

This project involves running experiments with the LoraCSE model to evaluate its performance. Here's how to access and run the code:

- Open the LoraCSE.ipynb notebook to access the code for all the experiments.
- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the experiments with your GPU and view the results.
- After running the experiments, refer to LoRACSE.pdf for a detailed analysis of the results.

The analysis presented in LoRACSE.pdf provides insights into the performance of the LoraCSE model under different conditions. Use this information to fine-tune the model and improve its accuracy for your specific use case.


## Performance

|              Model              | Avg. STS |
|:-------------------------------|:--------:|
| sup-loracse-bert-base (batch size 512) |  81.55  |
| sup-loracse-roberta-base (batch size 512) |   82.49  |
| sup-loracse-roberta-large (batch size 375) |   84.69  |

## Requirements

To run the experiment, which involves processing large amounts of data with a batch size of 512, your GPU must have at least 40GB of RAM.
Here are the compatible GPUs:

- V100
- A6000
- A40
- RTX3090 (four required)

In this experiment, we use four A40.
